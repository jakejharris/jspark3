"""Additive display-reserve KV backing on GB10 (overlay/display_kv/).

Wires ``glm53_display_kv`` into vLLM in three places:

1. ``gpu_worker.determine_available_memory``: after the profiled ordinary KV
   budget is computed, open the DRM display pool and set
   ``available_kv_cache_memory_bytes`` to ``budget(P, self.rank)`` =
   min(P, sealed per-rank cap) + credit C (S7). The extra blocks are backed by
   the pool. The multimodal IPC reserve applied on return is 0 in the sealed
   configuration (mm_ipc_gpu_memory_gb 0, no GPU video backend); G3's exact
   block-count check would see a reserve of one block or more.
2. ``gpu_model_runner._allocate_kv_cache_tensors``: the two
   ``torch.zeros(size, int8, device)`` become ``alloc_int8(size, device)``,
   which carves from the pool while a tensor fits and falls back to
   ``torch.zeros`` otherwise; ``report()`` logs the split once.
3. ``kv_connector_model_runner_mixin`` cross-layer allocation: same swap (not
   the path this model takes, patched for consistency).
4. ``gpu/attn_utils._allocate_kv_cache`` (the v2 model runner, which is what
   this image actually runs for GLM-5.3): same plan + swap as (2).

Also installs ``glm53_display_kv.py`` next to ``gpu_worker.py``.

JSpark3 v1.4 fork of MiaAI-Lab #234 (cd504b69): the shared library is never
copied; the runtime loads the sealed build from the read-only recipe mount
(GLM53_DISPLAY_KV_LIB). Both allocators call ``identity(kv_cache_config)``
right after ``report()``. Idempotent; fails closed on anchor drift.
